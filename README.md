# Cocktail Database 
Using the CocktailAPI, I built a user friendly site that displays all of the drinks in a user-friendly carousel format.

# How it was made
I built the entire project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The CocktailDB takes over the bulk of the text content in the project and only a few recipes were adjusted to fix a few spelling errors I noticed.
