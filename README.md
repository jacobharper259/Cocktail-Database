# Cocktail Database 
Using the CocktailAPI, I built a user friendly site that displays all of the drinks in a user-friendly carousel format.

# How it was made
I built the entire project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The CocktailDB takes over the bulk of the text content in the project and only a few recipes were adjusted to fix a few spelling errors I noticed. 

# Optimizations 
In this project some of the images were high quality images, to put less strain on the user I rendered only 5 images at a time and only show 3 at a time, so whenn the user swipes or clicks to switch recipes, its quick and reliable.

# Lessons Learned
When building the carousel to move between recipes, I made it overly complicated because I didn't look at examples. I just built the site using my image of what a carousel should look like. This made it harder for implenting a visually appealing mobile site. Mobile-First should have been the approach I took here.
